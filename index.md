# Welcome to the Databrewers Project

Welcome to the official website of the **Databrewers Project** for the **Applied Data Analysis** course at EPFL. This project aims to analyze beer review data, focusing on insights and trends in beer reviews and their characteristics.

Beers have been enjoyed for centuries across cultures, and today beer enthusiasts share their experiences and rate their favorite brews on online platforms such as [BeerAdvocate](https://www.beeradvocate.com) and [RateBeer](https://www.ratebeer.com). With a vast number of reviews available online, these platforms have become a gold mine for analyzing trends in beer preferences, consumption patterns, and the factors that influence peopleâ€™s choices.

Our project focus on how beer ratings and reviews evolve over time, especially with respect to seasonal and long-term changes. How do beer preferences shift across different seasons, and how do climate and geographical factors influence these choices? Does the alcohol content or beer style impact ratings differently depending on the time of year? Furthermore, can we identify specific beers that are consistently linked to certain seasons? By addressing these questions, we aim to provide actionable insights for brewers, marketers, and enthusiasts alike, helping them align their offerings with the dynamic preferences of consumers.

## Dataset

For our study, we were provided with two distinct datasets. The first one contained data from the BeerAdvocate website, while the second contained data from the RateBeer website. After some preliminary analysis, we decided that the data from the BeerAdvocate website was enough to conduct our analysis.

</div>

We decided to focus especially on the data generated by users based in the United States of America. It represents most of the overall data and allows us to study more in-depth the differences in ratings between the states.

The diversity of beer styles can make it difficult to compare; to avoid redundancy of styles with similar characteristics, styles were simplified using an article from the [BeerAdvocate website](https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/styles/), reducing the number of beer styles from 105 to 45.

## Ratings

To understand the seasonal analysis, it is important to understand how the beers are rated. In both reviews and ratings dataframes, six columns contain metrics (which are a score out of 5): **appearance, aroma, taste, mouthfeel, overall and rating**.

The rating metrics is computed based on the five other scores with the following formula:

<script type="text/javascript" async
  src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.7/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML">
</script>

$$
\text{Rating} = 0.06 \cdot \text{Appearance} + 0.24 \cdot \text{Aroma} + 0.4 \cdot \text{Taste} + 0.1 \cdot \text{Mouthfeel} + 0.2 \cdot \text{Overall}
$$



The rating metric takes into account all other metrics, weighted by their importance; therefore, for numerical study of the ratings, only the rating metric will be investigated.

### 1. Seasonal influence on beer ratings for ABV category

One important detail about the beers is their **Alcohol By Volume (ABV)**, expressed as a percentage ranging from 0 to 100%. To analyze how the alcohol content of a beer might influence its preference across seasons, and by extension, different weather conditions, we categorized the beers into three groups: **low** (0-5.4%), **middle** (5.4-8.7%), and **high** (8.7-67.5%) ABV.

Will low-alcohol beers be favored in the warm season? Or in the cold season?

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
  <div style="width: 50%;">
    {% include season_ratings_high_abv.html %}
  </div>
  <div style="width: 50%;">
    {% include season_ratings_low_abv.html %}
  </div>
</div>

To answer these questions, we group beers by season and alcohol content category, and compare their scores. As we can see, ratings are not constant throughout the year, and high and low peaks can be observed for both low and high ABV beers. In winter, high-alcohol content beers reach their highest peak, while low-alcohol content beers reach their lowest peak at this time of year in terms of rating. In summer, on the other hand, high ABV beers are the least rated. And in spring, low ABV beers reach their highest rating. We can therefore conclude that during the warm season (summer, spring), low-alcohol beers are preferred, while as the cold season (winter) approaches, users tend to favor high-alcohol beers.

### 2. Seasonal trend in beer ratings at the scale of the United States

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; width: 80%;">
  {% include beer_styles_seasons_ratings.html %}
</div>

Pale Lager has its best ratings around spring and worse around winter, with a difference of about 0.1. Some may not consider this a sufficient difference, but remember that there are more than 100k ratings for this beer style. For other styles, the difference is harder to see. With an ANOVA test, some trends in rating variability across seasons emerge: 

- **Warmer months**:  
  Lighter styles such as Pale Lager, Pale Ale, IPA, Wild Beer, Amber/Red Ale, Brown Ale, and Strong Ale perform better in the spring and summer. These styles score higher in the warmer months, consistent with the preference for lighter, more refreshing beers during this time. Pale Lager and IPA show the most improvement in summer, while Amber/Red Ale has the highest ratings in summer compared to other seasons. 

- **Colder months**:  
  Richer and heavier styles such as Wheat Beer, Barleywine, Strong Ale have higher ratings in winter and fall. These beers, known for their fuller body and warming qualities, are more popular in the colder months. Barleywine and Wheat Beer are especially popular in winter, while Strong Ale has its highest ratings in fall, outperforming both spring and summer.

- **Minimal or No Seasonal Variation**:  
  Stouts and Porters show very little seasonal variation. The differences are minimal, indicating that these styles have consistent appeal throughout the year regardless of season.

That said, the magnitude of the observed differences between seasons, while statistically significant, is small (around 0.05), and very little variation is observed with ratings alone at the United States scale.


### 3. Seasonal trend in beer ratings across the states

While beer style preferences show some variation across the United States over the seasons, it remains limited overall. However, given that the U.S. is a very large country, some regions may not experience the same weather conditions across seasons. This raises the question: will this limited variation persist at the state level, or will we observe greater differences in preferences by state?

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
  {% include highest_rated_beer_styles_by_states_season.html %}
</div>

By visualizing the highest-rated beer styles by state and season, we can now see more clearly how this evolves over the seasons. To simplify our analysis, we regroup the states by region as follows:
- **Northeast** (e.g. New York, Massachusetts)
- **South** (e.g. Texas, Florida)
- **West** (e.g. California, Arizona)
- **Midwest** (e.g. Minnesota, Wisconsin)

In winter, the West favors Wild beer and Lambic-Unblended, while Montana stands out with Dark Mild Ale. The South prefers Stouts and Wild beer, while the Midwest and Northeast lean towards Dark Mild Ale and Stout, with Lambic-Fruit in the Northeast. In spring, the West favors Pale Mild Ale, low alcohol beer, and Lambic-Fruit, while the South and Northeast also lean toward Lambic-Fruit, with the South showing a preference for Kristalweizen. The Midwest also embraces Kristalweizen, with a shift from Stout to Lambic-Unblended. In summer, the West continues to favor Pale Mild Ale and Lambic-Fruit, while the South shifts to Lambic-Unblended. The Northeast stays consistent with Lambic-Fruit, and the Midwest prefers Lambic-Fruit and Milk/Sweet Stout. In fall, the West still prefers Lambic-Fruit but starts moving toward Strong Pale Ale, especially in Oregon. The South continues with Lambic-Unblended, while some states begin leaning towards Pale Mild Ale. The Midwest remains consistent with Lambic-Fruit but shows growing interest in Stout, while the Northeast favors Lambic-Unblended and Wild beer.

What we can conclude from this is that, as the seasons progress, beer style preferences shift, with fruitier, lighter styles being preferred in warmer months and stronger beers like Stout and Dark Mild Ale becoming more popular as the temperature cools.

## Sentiment and semantic analysis

In addition to numerical ratings, **textual reviews** play a crucial role in understanding consumer preferences and perceptions of beer. **Sentiment and semantic analysis** are powerful techniques that allow us to extract insights from the textual data in the BeerAdvocate reviews.

### 1. Sentiment analysis

When it comes to beer reviews, the words that people use can tell us a lot about their preferences. In this section, we dive into the words used in beer reviews to uncover which ones are linked to positive ratings and which ones are tied to negative feedback. By analyzing these words, we can start to understand what makes a beer enjoyable for consumers, and what makes it not that enjoyable.

To investigate, we categorized beers based on their ratings: beers with ratings greater than 4/5 are considered **highly rated** (positive), while those with ratings lower than 3/5 are seen as **poorly rated** (negative).

We generated two word clouds: one for the most common word pairs found in positive reviews and another for those in negative reviews. At first glance, it was clear that some word pairs were more associated with high-rated beers, while others appeared more often in lower-rated ones. These word clouds provided a valuable insight into the language of beer enthusiasts, highlighting the key aspects they appreciate or dislike in their beer experiences.

<figure style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/src/graph/sentiment_analysis.png" alt="Sentiment Analysis WordCloud" width="800">
</figure>

Certain words and phrases seem to appear a lot for beers that get high marks. Words like **"full bodied"** **"dark chocolate"** and **"roasted malts"** popped up frequently in positive reviews. It highlights beer caractectistics that consumers appreciate.

There were also words that kept appearing in negative reviews. For instance, phrases like **"light bodied"** and **"yellow color"** seemed to show up more often when beers werenâ€™t getting high marks. These terms seemed to be tied to beers that reviewers werenâ€™t as impressed by.

Some word pairs, like **"medium bodied"** appeared in both positive and negative reviews, suggesting that context plays a big role in how we perceive these terms. Some characteristics of a beer could be appreciated by some drinkers but not by others which could explain this.

These results allow us to determine the characteristic that an ideal beer should have, and those that it should not have, in order to be enjoyed by consumers.


#### 2. Semantic analysis

While sentiment analysis uncovers the emotional tone behind a review, semantic analysis digs deeper into the meanings of words, helping us understand how different characteristics are associated with the beers' appeal. Itâ€™s not just about whether a beer is liked or disliked; itâ€™s about why it stands out in the first place.
By analyzing the specific language used in high rated reviews, we can uncover the key qualities that turn a simple beer into a fan favorite. In this section, we will dive into a semantic comparison of beer reviews across seasons to explore which characteristics define the most-loved beers in each time of the year. 

##### Winter: the warmth of rich flavors

Winter brings a shift in beer preferences, with consumers favoring beers that provide warmth and depth. The colder months seem to drive people toward richer, fuller beers. In this section, we explore the most frequently used words in positively rated beer reviews during winter, across four distinct aspects: **palate, aroma, mouthfeel, and taste.**

- **Palate**: In winter, beer drinkers often seek bold flavors that leave a lasting impression. The graph below highlights the most common words associated with the palate of highly-rated winter beers, showcasing the preferences for richer
- **Aroma**: The aroma plays a crucial role in winter beer enjoyment. As the colder months call for comforting and complex scents, the plot below reveals the most frequent descriptors found in positive reviews, highlighting the
- **Mouthfeel**: A smooth, rich mouthfeel is a key feature for many winter beers.
- **Taste**: Finally, the taste of winter beers is often characterized by more robust flavors. The graph for this section shows the most frequent words found in positive reviews of winter beers, revealing the complex, layered tastes that make these brews particularly satisfying during the colder months.

##### Spring: light and refreshing notes

As the days get warmer and nature starts to bloom, beer preferences shift toward lighter, more refreshing options. In this section, we explore the most frequently used words in positively rated beer reviews during spring, again focusing on the palate, aroma, mouthfeel, and taste.

- **Palate**: Spring beers tend to favor lighter profiles. The plot below highlights the most commonly used words to describe the palate of spring beers, showing a preference for 
- **Aroma**: The aroma of spring beers often evokes a sense of freshness and floral notes. In this plot, we see the most frequent descriptors used for spring beer aromas 
- **Mouthfeel**: A crisp and clean mouthfeel is highly appreciated in spring beers. The graph here showcases the most common words related to mouthfeel in positive reviews, revealing preferences for beers with a â€¦. texture.
- **Taste**: Spring beers tend to be flavorful yet not too heavy. The plot for taste reveals the common words used to describe the flavors of highly rated spring beers, showing a preference for beers with â€¦. tastes that align with the seasonâ€™s rejuvenating atmosphere.

##### Summer: bold and fruity sensations

Summer is a time for outdoor activities, and beer preferences reflect the need for brews that are both refreshing and flavorful. Summer beers are often characterized by bold, fruity flavors. This section delves into the most frequently used words in positively rated beer reviews during the summer months, focusing on palate, aroma, mouthfeel, and taste.

- **Palate**: Summer beers are known for their refreshing palate. The graph below highlights the most common words used to describe the palate of highly-rated summer beers, emphasizing a preference for beers that are â€¦. and easy to drink under the sun.

- **Taste**: Taste in summer beers leans toward fruit-forward and thirst-quenching flavors. The plot below reveals the most common words used to describe the taste of highly-rated summer beers, showing 

##### Fall: complex and hearty brews

As the temperatures begin to cool and the leaves change, beer drinkers look for brews that offer complexity and warmth. Fall is the season for richer, spicier, and more robust beers that pair perfectly with autumn flavors. In this section, we examine the most frequently used words in positively rated beer reviews during fall, again analyzing the palate, aroma, mouthfeel, and taste.

- **Palate**: Fall beers are often characterized by a fuller, more complex palate. The plot below highlights the most common words used to describe the palate of highly-rated fall beers, 
- **Aroma**: The aroma of fall beers often includes warm, spicy, and earthy notes. The graph here displays the most frequent descriptors found in positive reviews of fall beers, showing a trend towards â€¦â€¦ aromas that are associated with the season's cooler weather.
- **Mouthfeel**: A rich, full-bodied mouthfeel is key for many fall beers. The plot here presents the most commonly used words to describe mouthfeel, indicating a preference for beers with a â€¦texture that complements the richness of the season.
- **Taste**: Taste in fall beers tends to be deep and satisfying, with more robust and spiced flavors. The graph below highlights the most common words used to describe the taste of highly-rated fall beers, showing a shift toward flavors that match the season's warmth and complexity.

## Conclusion

In this project, we explored beer reviews, analyzing patterns in ratings, styles, and consumer preferences across seasons and regions in the United States. By leveraging numerical ratings and textual reviews, we uncovered insights into how beer preferences vary with alcohol content, seasonal changes, and geographical trends. Sentiment analysis of textual reviews further enriched our understanding, putting light on the aspects the most valued by beer enthusiasts.

Our findings reveal that preferences are not only shaped by individual tastes but are also influenced by external factors like weather and cultural trends. Brewers and marketers can use these insights to better align their offerings with consumer expectations. Through this analysis, we hope to contribute to a deeper understanding of the dynamic and evolving beer landscape, offering value to researchers, breweries, and beer lovers alike.
