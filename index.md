# Welcome to the Databrewers Project

Welcome to the official website of the **Databrewers Project** for the **Applied Data Analysis** course at EPFL. This project aims to analyze beer review data, focusing on insights and trends in beer reviews and their characteristics.

Beers have been enjoyed for centuries across cultures, and today beer enthusiasts share their experiences and rate their favorite brews on online platforms such as [BeerAdvocate](https://www.beeradvocate.com) and [RateBeer](https://www.ratebeer.com). With a vast number of reviews available online, these platforms have become a gold mine for analyzing trends in beer preferences, consumption patterns, and the factors that influence people’s choices.

## Dataset

For our study, we were provided with two distinct datasets. The first one contained data from the BeerAdvocate website, while the second contained data from the RateBeer website.  After some preliminary analysis, we decided that the data from the BeerAdvocate website was enough to conduct our analysis.
