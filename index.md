# Welcome to the Databrewers Project

Welcome to the official website of the **Databrewers Project** for the **Applied Data Analysis** course at EPFL. This project aims to analyze beer review data, focusing on insights and trends in beer reviews and their characteristics.

## About the Project

In this project, we explore datasets from BeerAdvocate to:
- Analyze user reviews and ratings of beers.
- Compare beer qualities (appearance, aroma, taste, etc.).
- Explore different patterns across user reviews and beer categories.

Our team, the **Databrewers**, has been working on extracting useful insights from data to understand the impact of various factors on beer ratings and reviews.
