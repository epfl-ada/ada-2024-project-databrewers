# Welcome to the Databrewers Project

Welcome to the official website of the **Databrewers Project** for the **Applied Data Analysis** course at EPFL. 
This project aims to analyze beer review data, focusing on insights and trends in beer reviews and their characteristics.

Beers have been enjoyed for centuries across cultures, and today beer enthusiasts share their experiences 
and rate their favorite brews on online platforms such as [BeerAdvocate](https://www.beeradvocate.com) 
and [RateBeer](https://www.ratebeer.com). 
With a vast number of reviews available online, these platforms have become a gold mine for analyzing trends in beer preferences, 
consumption patterns, and the factors that influence people’s choices.

## Dataset

For our study, we were provided with two distinct datasets. 
The first one contained data from the BeerAdvocate website, while the second contained data from the RateBeer website.  
After some preliminary analysis, we decided that the data from the BeerAdvocate website was enough to conduct our analysis.

We decided to focus especially on the data generated by users based in the United States of America. 
It represents most of the overall data and allows us to study more in-depth the differences in ratings between the states.

TODO: IMPORT IMAGE OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF RATINGS 

The diversity of beer styles can make it difficult to compare; to avoid redundancy of styles with similar characteristics, styles were simplified using an article from the [BeerAdvocate website](https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/styles/), reducing the number of beer styles from 105 to 45. 

## Ratings

To understand the seasonal analysis, it is important to understand how the beers are rated. 
In both reviews and ratings dataframes, six columns contain metrics (which are a score out of 5): **appearance, aroma, taste, mouthfeel, overall and rating**. 

The rating metrics is computed based on the five other scores with the following formula :

`rating = 0.06*appearance + 0.24*aroma + 0.4*taste + 0.1*mouthfeel + 0.2*overall`

The rating metric takes into account all other metrics, weighted by their importance; therefore, for numerical study of the ratings, only the rating metric will be investigated. 

1. Seasonal influence on beer ratings for ABV category

One important detail about the beers is their **Alcohol By Volume (ABV)**, expressed as a percentage ranging from 0 to 100%.
To analyze how the alcohol content of a beer might influence its preference across seasons, and by extension, different weather conditions, we categorized the beers into three groups: **low** (0-5.4%), **middle** (5.4-8.7%), and **high** (8.7-67.5%) ABV.

Will low-alcohol beers be favored in the warm season? Or in the cold season?

TODO: ADD SEASONAL RATINGS GRAPHS

To answer these questions, we group beers by season and alcohol content category, and compare their scores. 
As we can see, ratings are not constant throughout the year, and high and low peaks can be observed for both low and high ABV beers. In winter, high-alcohol content beers reach their highest peak, while low-alcohol content beers reach their lowest peak at this time of year in terms of rating. In summer, on the other hand, high ABV beers are the least rated. 
And in spring, low ABV beers reach their highest rating. We can therefore conclude that during the warm season (summer, spring), low-alcohol beers are preferred, while as the cold season (winter) approaches, users tend to favor high-alcohol beers.

2. Seasonal trend in beer ratings at the scale of the United States

3. Seasonal trend in beer ratings across the states

We now know that beer style preferences do not vary much across the United States over the seasons. But will this also translate to the state level? Or will we see more variation by state?

TODO: ADD THE INTERACTIF GRAPH WITH HIGHEST RATED BEER STYLE BY STATE AND SEASON

By visualizing the highest-rated beer styles by state and season, we can now see more clearly how this evolves over the seasons. 
To simplify our analysis, we regroup the states by region as follows:
- **Northeast** (e.g. New York, Massachusetts)
- **South** (e.g. Texas, Florida)
- **West** (e.g. California, Arizona)
- **Midwest** (e.g. Minnesota, Wisconsin)

In winter, the West favors Wild beer and Lambic-Unblended, while Montana stands out with Dark Mild Ale. 
The South prefers Stouts and Wild beer, while the Midwest and Northeast lean towards Dark Mild Ale and Stout, with Lambic-Fruit in the Northeast. 
In spring, the West favors Pale Mild Ale, low alcohol beer, and Lambic-Fruit, while the South and Northeast also lean toward Lambic-Fruit, with the South showing a preference for Kristalweizen. 
The Midwest also embraces Kristalweizen, with a shift from Stout to Lambic-Unblended. 
In summer, the West continues to favor Pale Mild Ale and Lambic-Fruit, while the South shifts to Lambic-Unblended. 
The Northeast stays consistent with Lambic-Fruit, and the Midwest prefers Lambic-Fruit and Milk/Sweet Stout. 
In fall, the West still prefers Lambic-Fruit but starts moving toward Strong Pale Ale, especially in Oregon. 
The South continues with Lambic-Unblended, while some states begin leaning towards Pale Mild Ale. 
The Midwest remains consistent with Lambic-Fruit but shows growing interest in Stout, while the Northeast favors Lambic-Unblended and Wild beer.

What we can conclude from this is that, as the seasons progress, beer style preferences shift, with fruitier, lighter styles being preferred in warmer months and stronger beers like Stout and Dark Mild Ale becoming more popular as the temperature cools.
