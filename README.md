# DataBrewers

## Abstract
The aim of our project is to analyze beer preference shifts across seasons and in response to weather changes, events and cultural festivities. This could significantly help professionals (brewers, marketers, etc.) by providing insights into customer preferences. By understanding seasonal trends, brewers can adjust their product offerings to align more closely with consumer demand. 
Moreover, as a conclusion of our research, we could suggest the best beer that would be the perfect match for each season/festivity, in the form of a time fresco. 


## Research questions
- Are there some notable patterns through the seasons ?
- How do beer ratings vary by season ?
- Which beer characteristics are the most important through the seasons ?
- Are there some beers that are more consumed during specific seasons ?
- How does the weather influence the ratings ?

## Proposed additional datasets
- Potentially: Dataset with the weather in different states through the year. It would enable us to analyze the impact of the weather on the beer choices and the ratings.
