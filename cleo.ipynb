    "The aim of this project is to analyze beer preference shifts across seasons and in response to weather changes, events and cultural festivities. This could significantly help professionals (brewers, marketers, etc.) by providing insights into customer preferences. \n",
    "By understanding seasonal trends, brewers can adjust their product offerings to align more closely with consumer demand. \n",
    "Moreover, as a conclusion of our research, we could suggest the best beer that would be the perfect match for each season/festivity, in the form of a time fresco. \n",

    "Our analysis will primarly focus on the reviews published by users based in the United State of America. The reason for this choice is that it is the country were the majority of reviews are done, and it provides us with enough data to conduct our analysis.\n"

    "For this project, we choose to only use the BeerAdvocate dataset and to discard the RateBeer dataset due to several analytical and practical considerations:\n",
    "1. **The Herding Effect:** As explained in the paper \"When Sheep Shop: Measuring Herding Effects in Product Ratings with Natural Experiments\" from Gael Lederrey and Robert West, initial ratings can influence the following ones. By focusing on a single dataset, we can better control for this effect within a single user community. Including RateBeer might introduce inconsistent herding effects that could skew comparative analyses.\n",
    "2. **Inconsistant Rating Standards:** Both BeerAdvocate and RateBeer communities likely develop their own informal standards for beer ratings. Focusing on a single platform like BeerAdvocate allows dor a more cohesive dataset, with users who rate within the same context, minimizing cross-platform variance.\n",
    "3. **Data Sufficiency:** The BeerAdvocate dataset provides us with enough reviews and data to perform meaningful analysis and draw reliable insights."
